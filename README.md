nodered-zwave
=============

This is a nodered node for communicating with a zwave network. For it to work it requires node-openzwave (npm install openzwave)

At the moment it can only be used as an output and there can only be one of these instantiated within nodered (it claims exclusive use of the USB stick)

This is still in beta and is likely to change and have bugs
